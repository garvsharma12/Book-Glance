## 🛠 Technology Stack

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/ui, Wouter routing  
**Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM  
**AI Services**: OpenAI / Gemini (configurable) for recommendations and descriptions  
**Infrastructure**: Vite build tool, Winston logging, Device-based auth  
**Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend & API), PostgreSQL database

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database (local or cloud)
- OpenAI API key

### Local Development

1. **Clone and Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd BookGlance
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   # See Environment Configuration section below for all variables
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Push the database schema
   npm run db:push:dev
   
   # Optional: Set up initial schemas/data
   npm run db:setup
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Production Deployment

#### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm i -g vercel
   
   # Deploy
   vercel
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   In your Vercel dashboard, add all required environment variables (see Environment Configuration below)

## 🔐 Environment Configuration

### Required Variables

Create a `.env` file with these required variables:

```env
# Database (Required)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# OpenAI API (Required for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here

# Optional: Google Vision API (minimal implementation)
GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your_google_vision_key
```

### API Key Setup

**OpenAI API** (Required - for book summaries and recommendations):
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create an account and add billing
3. Generate an API key in the API Keys section

**Google Vision API** (Optional - limited implementation):
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Enable the Vision API
3. Create credentials and get your API key

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Book Detection
- Users photograph bookshelves using their device camera
- Image is processed to extract text from book spines
- Custom parsing algorithms identify book titles and authors
- Book metadata fetched from external APIs

### 2. Data Enhancement
- Basic book metadata fetched from Google Books API
- OpenAI generates rich summaries and enhanced ratings
- All data cached in PostgreSQL for performance

### 3. Personalized Recommendations
- Users can import reading history from Goodreads CSV export
- Users can manually input reading preferences
- AI analyzes user's reading patterns and preferences
- Generates personalized match scores with detailed reasoning

### 4. Smart Caching
- **Database Layer**: Stores enhanced book data permanently
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents expensive API overuse
- **Device Identification**: Preferences linked to device cookies

## 📊 Performance Features

- **Lazy Loading**: Images and data load as needed
- **Request Batching**: Efficient API usage
- **Progressive Enhancement**: App works even if AI services are down
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching reduces costs

## 🛡 Security & Privacy

- **Device-Based Storage**: Reading preferences stored per device, no accounts required
- **API Key Protection**: All sensitive keys in environment variables
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas validate all user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse and reduces costs
